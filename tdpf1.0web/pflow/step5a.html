<H2>Step 5a: Animation (Flow Path Evolution)</H2>

<p>This step shows the evolution of the flow paths computed in Step 4a.</p>

<UL>
<LI>Click the "Animation" button to bring up the 
        Animation Dialog Box. 
        
<LI>Set the animation speed by specifying the amount of travel time 
(in days or years) that is equal to 1 second of animation time. 
The appropriate speed will depend on the domain length, average 
hydraulic gradient, and hydraulic properties. For an initial attempt, 
try setting 1 second of animation time = 10 days. If the resulting 
animation is too slow, then increase the animation speed (for example, 
1 second of animation time = 100 days). If the animation is too 
fast, decrease the animation speed (for example, 1 second of animation 
time = 1 day).  
        
<LI>Set the animation smoothness by specifying 
        number of frames per second. 
        
<LI>Click "OK" and wait for the window to be 
        refreshed. 
        
<LI>To start the animation, click anywhere inside 
        the window, below the buttons. 
        
<LI>Additional clicks alternately freeze and 
        unfreeze the animation. 
        
<LI>The elapsed travel time is shown at the bottom of the window.</LI>
