<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The two-dimensional model ParticleFlow simulates flow in a rectangular domain. 
A key purpose of the ParticleFlow model is to illustrate how heterogeneities in 
hydraulic properties cause the spatial spreading of fluid particles. This spreading 
is analogous to macro-scale solute dispersion.</P>

<P><IMG height=166 src="domain.gif" width=401></P>

<P>The rectangular flow domain (see above figure) is assumed to be bounded 
on the left and right sides (AD and BC) by specified head boundaries, and 
on the top and bottom (AB and DC) by no-flow boundaries. Assuming that the 
head along AD is higher then the head along BC, the average flow is from left 
to right. 


<H2>Governing Equation</H2>

<P>The steady-state ground-water flow equation to be solved is</P>

<P><IMG height=80 src="floweq.gif" width=320></P>

<P>where <I>h</I> is hydraulic head, and <I>K</I>
is hydraulic conductivity (assumed isotropic), and <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> 
are the Cartesian coordinates.</P>

<H2>Boundary Conditions</H2>

<P>The boundary condition along AD is</P>

<P><IMG src="bcleft.gif" height=55 width=90></P>

<P>where <i>h<SUB>1</SUB></i> is a constant. The boundary condition along BC is

<P><IMG src="bcright.gif" height=55 width=90></P>

<P>where <i>h<SUB>2</SUB></i> is also a constant. The boundary condition along AB and DC is

<P><IMG src="bctopbot.gif" height=70 width=90></P>

<P>The computer model ParticleFlow solves the above equations by the finite element 
method. The flow domain is represented by a rectangular mesh composed of square cells, 
each is divided into two triangular elements. Linear basis functions are used 
in the finite element formulation. After solving for hydraulic head <I>h</I>, 
the <I>x</I> and <I>z</I> components
of the average interstitial velocity vector are computed by</P>

<P><IMG src="velocity.gif" height=80 width=370></P>

<P>where <I>n</I> is porosity. The velocity vectors are used for calculating
flow paths and the advective movement of fluid particles.</P>

<P>In a flow field with nonuniform velocity, a cloud of fluid particles will 
tend to spread. This spreading can be described by the spatial variance 
(in the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> directions) of particle positions, defined as:

<P><IMG src="variance.gif" height=100 width=500></P>

<P>where <I>N</I> is the total number of fluid particles, <I>x<sub>i</sub></I> and 
<I>y<sub>i</sub></I> 
are the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> coordinates of the <I>i</I>-th particle,  
and <I>x<sub>c</sub></I> and <I>y<sub>c</sub></I> denote the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> positions of the 
center of mass, defined as

<P><IMG src="cntrmass.gif" height=100 width=370></P>

<P>If each fluid particle is assumed to carry a fixed amount of solute mass, 
then particle spreading is analogous to macro-scale solute dispersion. 
In the macro-dispersion approach, the small-scale variation of velocity 
is not explicitly simulation. Instead, solute spreading is characterized 
by a dispersion tensor. The dispersion process is called Fickean if the 
plot of the spatial variances <I>S<sub>xx</sub></I> and <I>S<sub>yy</sub></I> 
versus time show straight-line relations. In this case, the components of the 
dispersion coefficients can be estimated by
