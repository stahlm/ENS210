<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>A topography-driven flow system is one in which ground water flows 
from higher-elevation recharge areas, where hydraulic head is higher, 
to lower-elevation discharge areas, where hydraulic head is lower. 
This type of flow system is commonly encountered in ground-water basins. 
The main factors that control ground-water flow are basin geometry, 
shape of the water table, and the distribution of hydraulic properties. 
A key purpose of the TopoDrive model is to enable the user to investigate 
how these factors control ground-water flow.</P>

<P>For a two-dimensional vertical section, the boundaries of the flow domain 
(see above figure) are as follows :</P>

<UL>
<LI>The top boundary (AB) is the water table, which is assumed to lie 
close to land surface.  
        

<LI>The two vertical boundaries (BC and AD) and the bottom boundary (DC) are 
no flow boundaries.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The no-flow boundaries might represent ground-water flow divides or 
low-permeability bedrock that bounds the basin. Note that by specifying 
the position of the water table, it is assumed that the pattern of 
recharge and discharge is such that the water table is maintained at 
steady state.</P>

<H2>Governing Equation</H2>

<P>Steady-state flow of ground water in the vertical section
is governed by the equation</P>

<P><IMG height=80 src="floweq.gif" width=320></P>

<P>where <I>h</I> is hydraulic head, and <I>K<SUB>xx</SUB></I> and <I>K<SUB>zz</SUB></I>
are the principal values of the hydraulic conductivity tensor. The principal
directions are assumed to be parallel to the cartesian axes <I>x</I>and <I>z</I>.</P>

<H2>Boundary Conditions</H2>

<P>Assuming the position of the water table is known, the boundary condition along 
the water table (AB) is</P>

<P><IMG height=55 src="wtbc.gif" width=70></P>

<P>where <I>z</I> is the elevation of the water table.</P>

<P>Along the vertical boundaries BC and AD, the no-flow boundary condition
is</P>

<P><IMG height=70 src="vertbc.gif" width=90></P>

<P>Along bottom boundary CD, the no-flow boundary condition is </P>

<P><IMG height=70 src="horzbc.gif" width=90></P>

<P>The computer model TopoDrive solves the above equations by the finite 
element method. The flow domain is represented by a deformed rectangular mesh, 
and each quadrilateral cell is divided into two triangular elements. 
Linear basis functions are used in the finite element formulation. 
After solving for hydraulic head <I>h</I>, the <I>x</I> and <I>z</I> components
of the average interstitial velocity vector are computed by</P>

<P><IMG height=80 src="velocity.gif" width=370></P>

<P>where <I>n</I> is porosity. The velocity vectors are used for calculating
flow paths and the advective movement of fluid particles.</P>

<P>Running the model involves 7 steps. To begin each step, click the 
corresponding button at the top of the window. A dialog box appears 
for you to enter the necessary input data. The three buttons on the 
second row allow you to zoom in, zoom out, and quit the model. </P>
