<H2>Step 7b: Animation (Particle Movement)</H2>

<p>This step shows the movement of fluid particles whose initial positions are specified in Step 6b.</p>
<UL>
<LI>Click the "Animation" button to bring up the 
        Animation Dialog Box. 
        
<LI>Set the animation speed by specifying the amount of travel time 
(in days or years) that is equal to 1 second of animation time. The 
appropriate speed will depend on the domain length, water table shape, 
and hydraulic properties. For an initial attempt, try setting 1 second 
of animation time = 10 days. If the resulting animation is too slow, 
then increase the animation speed (for example, 1 second of animation 
time = 100 days). If the animation is too fast, decrease the 
animation speed (for example, 1 second of animation time = 1 day). 
        
<LI>Set the animation smoothness by specifying 
        number of frames per second. 
        
<LI>Click "OK" and wait for the window to be 
        refreshed. 
        
<LI>To start the animation, click anywhere inside 
        the window (below the buttons). 
        
<LI>Additional clicks alternately freeze and 
        unfreeze the animation. 
        
<LI>The elapsed travel time is shown at the bottom of the window.</LI>

<P>Animation of fluid particle movement is computationally 
intensive because particle positions are computed "on the fly," 
that is, during the animation process. Animating a large number 
of fluid particles at fast animation speed could result in a "jerky" 
animation because the computer cannot update the screen at the 
required rate. If this occurs, stop the animation, reduce the 
number of particles (draw a smaller polygon and/or increase the 
particle spacing), and/or use a lower animation speed (reduced 
the travel time per second of animation time). The animation 
terminates when the last fluid particle exits the flow domain.</P>
